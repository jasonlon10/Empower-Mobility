<h1>Empower Mobility</h1>
The Empower Mobility website is a website for people from all walks of life looking to improve their mobility and movement capabilities. Empower Mobility offers free programmes at three different levels, allowing people to cater for their abilities. 

Users of the website will be able to learn more about the benefits of mobility training, the programmes available and Empower Mobility’s approach to movement and mobility. There is also a download page and form. The site is targeted at anyone that wants to reduce pain, improve how they feel or improve their performance.

Featured at the top of the page, the navigation shows the company name in the left corner: EMPOWER MOBILITY that links to the top of the page. 
The other navigation links are to the right: Home, Programmes and Download. 
The navigation clearly tells the user the name of the club and website and makes the different sections of information easy to find.

This outlines the three programmes available for download. These are overlaid on images that would suit the context of each programme. 
Each section also include a sub-heading to the programme title which provides a succinct outline of what the programme is about and how it can help the user. 
These programmes are in three sections with a border. 
This section provides an early indication on what Empower Mobility provides.

This section allows users to act on the information previously provided, with a prompt to start their movement journey. 
This section also contains a button that links to the download page. 
<h2>Footer</h2>
This section includes placeholder links to each social media platform. 
<h1>Testing</h1>
I have tested this website and it works on browsers including: Chrome, Firefox and Safari. 
The website is responsive and looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes. 
All text links and navigation on the website works. 
I have tested the download form and it requires entries in every fields, will only accept an email in the email field and the submit button works. 
<h1>Bugs</h1>
<h2>Unfixed bugs</h2>
On the Form on the Download page, the layout/sizing of the radio options are slightly off. I have not been able to find the bug in this. I believe it was when I was adjusting the placement of the form on the webpage that bug occurred. 
On the homepage and on the programme page, I have included a download button that should link to the download.html page. However, I first attempted to do this using a button element within <a></a>, however it was flagged within the validator. When trying to work around this with an input, this was also flagged. 

<h1>Validator Testing</h1>
<h2>HTML</h2>
Following removing the issues outlined in the bugs section above, no errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator. 
<h2>CSS</h2>
No errors were found when passing through the official (jigsaw) validator.
<h2>Accessibility </h2>
I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

<h1>Deployment</h1>
The site was deployed to GitHub. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch. 
Once the master branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the completed website.

<h1>Credits</h1>
<h2>Content</h2>
For all information on the website, I used my own experience within the health and fitness industry to create something I feel would be worthwhile for people. 
No text, concepts, etc. were directly sourced from any other sites with the information on the website being general info. 
The format and template for the README document has been sourced from Code Institute in the course materials. 
All icons used on the site were sourced from Font Awesome. 
All images in the site have been downloaded from the website Pexels. 

<h2>Coding Help</h2>
The outline template for the HTML body was sourced from Code Institute
Throughout the project I referred to the Code Institute Love Running Walkthrough project for both inspiration and troubleshooting for certain elements of the website. 
These have been outlined below:
The circle elements in the ‘Benefits section’ were adapted from the Love Running project. 
The programmes section was adapted from the Love Running project. 
The Footer section was sourced from the Love Running Project
The Form element was adapted from the Love Running project. 
When encountering difficulties with some elements of the code, I leaned heavily on Googling for help. Throughout this process I searched through coding forums and website, including HubSpot. 
Unfortunately, I did not keep a track of these different resources purely down to a lack of foresight that they would be required. These sites were used for supporting and researching reasons and I do not recall simply taking one piece of code from any site for any elements of the project. 
The only time I would have sourced code directly would be for some parts of the Love Running project outlined above, which would then have been adapted to suit my own requirements. 
I referenced the slack forum through to find people who may have been having similar issues to me.
